# nodelike
A node based roguelike

This repo is the basis of a series of tutorials in Javascript.  Installing will get the latest
version according to the author's development path; install at a given version to get the
version relevant to that step in the tutorial.

This is part of a video series that comes as a reification of
[this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/3r387p/how_hard_is_it_to_make_a_game_in_javascript_with/)
on how to make a text-mode game in Javascript.

The end result is actually a simplistic tutorial on one way to look at being a programmer, which touches only on the
node ecosystem.  This is not a comprehensive "how to program;" just one quick bootstrap that lets a person see one
approach, despite being new.

The end result is a playable console game, installable directly from `npm`.





## The plan

We're going to:

1. Build the actual `roguelike` out in the major-version-0s
1. Rebuild the thing from the ground up as a plausible set of not-practiced-developer steps in the major-version-1s
1. Construct the website
1. Write the written tutorial steps, akin to the Reddit post
1. Make the videos





## we do, in fact, need stinking badges
